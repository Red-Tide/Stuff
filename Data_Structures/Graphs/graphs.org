* Graphs

** G = (V, E)
   V: A finite non empty set of vertices
   E: A set of pairs of these vertices called edges

*** Undirected Graphs
    Graphs where all pairs of vertices are undirected that is to say that
    (u,v) == (v,u) for all edges

*** Digraphs
    Directed Graphs are graphs where all the pairs of edges are directed that is to say that
    (u,v) != (v,u) for all edges

    We would say that in this case if
